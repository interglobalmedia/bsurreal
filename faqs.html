          <li class="hangingindent">&#186; <b>bsurreal</b> is an interactive movie trivia game created with <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>jQuery</b>, and (JavaScript/jQuery) <b>cookies</b>.</li>
          <li class="hangingindent">&#186; I have created various dynamic and interactive effects throughout the site which are meant to encourage the user to interact with the web page while answering questions to a quiz.</li>
          <li class="hangingindent">&#186; I highly suggest engaging in the use of cookies to personalize the user experience during the game and/or while visiting the site. All it takes is to input a first and last name, first name only, or anonymous username the user will easily remember upon the next visit to the site.</li>
          <li class="hangingindent">&#186; All the user has to do is fill out his/her name in the form below and hit the submit button. A cookie is set in memory upon submit.</li>
          <li class="hangingindent">Don't want to be staring at the time-based greeting at the top of the page? Just click on the pink band with the words "Click Me" and it will immediately disappear!</li>
          <li class="hangingindent">&#186; Don't want to be staring at the greeting that appears above the movie category? Click on the movie image once, and it will disappear. Click on it a second time, and it will reappear!</li>
          <li class="hangingindent">&#186; Depending on the number of visits, the user will be greeted with a different friendly and personalized greeting.</li>
          <li class="hangingindent">&#186; The site keeps track of the current date and time. The time is kept by a dynamic clock which displays the local time and updates every second. It also doesn't rely on page re-loads or refreshes to advance.</li>
          <li class="hangingindent">&#186; The site keeps track of site updates. When a user lands on the page, he/she will be able to tell whether or not there have been any changes since his/her last visit.</li>
          <li class="hangingindent">There is a "stopwatch" on the Quiz Page which starts ticking when the user lands on it. When the user is ready to leave, he/she will know how much time has been spent on the . It could also be (loosely) used as a timer!</li>
          <li class="hangingindent">&#186; Each time after the user answers a question, a line of text will return moving the question location forward 1 number. For example, if the user has just started the game and has only answered one question, he/she will be prompted with "Question 1 of X". After answering two questions, he/she will be prompted with "Question 2 of X", and so on.</li>
          <li class="hangingindent">&#186; When the user has finished the the quiz, he/she will be told how many questions were answered correctly and what was his/her percentage of correct answers. Keep in mind that the score is only revealed upon completion of the quiz! Click on any tab in the navigation menu (except the Exit tab of course!) to get started. Enjoy the game!</li>
